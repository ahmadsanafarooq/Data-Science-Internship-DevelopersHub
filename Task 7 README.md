# Predictive Modeling for Diabetes Diagnosis

## Objective
The primary goal of this analysis is to build predictive models for diabetes diagnosis using a provided dataset and evaluate their performance.

## Workflow

### 1. Data Ingestion and Preliminary Analysis
The process begins by loading the dataset and conducting initial checks for data quality, including identifying missing values and duplicates. This ensures data integrity before further analysis.

### 2. Statistical Summary
A statistical overview is generated, encompassing data types, missing value counts, and descriptive statistics for numerical features. This provides a fundamental understanding of the data's characteristics.

### 3. Data Preprocessing
- Zero values in critical features (Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI) are replaced with NaN, treating them as potential missing data points.
- The distribution of the 'Outcome' variable (diabetes diagnosis) is explored to assess the prevalence of each outcome.

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
A comprehensive EDA is performed to uncover patterns and relationships within the data. This involves:

- **Visualization**: Employing diverse visual tools, including count plots, line plots, scatter plots, box plots, and a correlation heatmap, to gain insights into feature distributions, trends, relationships, and correlations.
- **Insight Generation**: These visualizations facilitate an understanding of the underlying data structure and potential predictors for diabetes diagnosis.

### 5. Model Development
The data is prepared for machine learning by:

- Separating features (X) from the target variable (y).
- Scaling features using StandardScaler to standardize their ranges for optimal model performance.
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets to enable model evaluation on unseen data.

### 6. Model Training and Evaluation
- Three models—Gradient Boosting, SVM, and Neural Network—are trained using the preprocessed data.
- Model performance is evaluated using F1 score and AUC-ROC, providing a comprehensive view of classification accuracy and discriminatory ability.
- Results are presented through clear metrics and an ROC curve visualization, allowing for comparative analysis of model performance.

## Key Findings
- The report identifies potential risk factors for diabetes based on the EDA and model feature importance.
- It establishes the best-performing model among the three based on the chosen evaluation metrics.
- Insights derived from the analysis can support healthcare professionals in early diabetes detection and intervention.

## Recommendations
- Further analysis may focus on feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and exploring alternative models for potential performance improvement.
- The developed models can be deployed to assist in preliminary diabetes risk assessment and guide further diagnostic procedures.
